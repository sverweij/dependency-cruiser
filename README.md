# Dependency cruiser ![Dependency cruiser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/master/doc/assets/ZKH-Dependency-recolored-160.png)

_Validate and visualize dependencies. With your rules._ JavaScript. TypeScript. CoffeeScript. ES6, CommonJS, AMD.

## What's this do?
![Snazzy dot output to whet your appetite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/master/doc/assets/sample-dot-output.png)


This runs through the dependencies in any JavaScript, TypeScript, LiveScript or CoffeeScript project and ...
  - ... **validates** them against (your own) [rules](./doc/rules-reference.md)
  - ... **reports** violated rules
    - in text (for your builds)
    - in graphics (for your eyeballs)

As a side effect it can generate [**cool dependency graphs**](./doc/real-world-samples.md)
you can stick on the wall to impress your grandma.

## How do I use it?

### Install it
- `npm install --save-dev dependency-cruiser` to use it as a validator in your project or...
- `npm install --global dependency-cruiser` if you just want to to inspect multiple projects.

### Show stuff to your grandma
To create a graph of the dependencies in your src folder, you'd run dependency
cruiser with output type `dot` and run _GraphViz dot_ on the result. In
a one liner:

```shell
depcruise --exclude "^node_modules" --output-type dot src | dot -T svg > dependencygraph.svg
```

- You can read more about what you can do with `--exclude` and other command line
  options in the
  [command line interface](./doc/cli.md)
  documentation.
- _[Real world samples](./doc/real-world-samples.md)_
  contains dependency cruises of some of the most used projects on npm.

### Validate things
#### Declare some rules
The easy way to get you started:

```shell
depcruise --init
```

This will create a `.dependency-cruiser.json` with some rules that make sense
in most projects (detecting **circular dependencies**, dependencies **missing**
in package.json, production code relying on dev- or optionalDependencies, ...).

Start adding your rules by tweaking that file.

Sample rule:
```json
{
    "forbidden": [{
        "name": "not-to-test",
        "comment": "don't allow dependencies from outside the test folder to test",
        "severity": "error",
        "from": { "pathNot": "^test" },
        "to": { "path": "^test" }
    }]
}
```

- To read more about writing rules check the
  [writing rules](./doc/rules-tutorial.md) tutorial
  or the [rules reference](./doc/rules-reference.md)
- You can find the `--init-rules` set   [here](./doc/rules.starter.json)

#### Report them
```sh
depcruise --validate .dependency-cruiser.json src
```

This will validate against your rules and shows any violations in an eslint-like format:

![sample err output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/master/doc/assets/sample-err-output.png)

There's more ways to report validations; in a graph (like the one on top of this
readme) or in a table.

- Read more about the err, dot, csv and html reporters in the
  [command line interface](./doc/cli.md)
  documentation.
- dependency-cruiser uses itself to check on itself in its own build process;
  see the `dependency-cruise` target in the
  [Makefile](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/blob/master/Makefile#L95)
