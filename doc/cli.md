 # dependency-cruiser command line interface
The command line interface is a straightforward affair - you pass it a bunch of
files, and dependency-cruiser will start cruising them: 

```sh
depcruise [options] <files-or-directories>
```

Below you'll find a list of command line options you can use, divided into ones that
are only available as options on the command line and into those also
available in dependency-cruiser configurations.

## Command line only options

### arguments - files and/ or directories
You can pass a bunch of files, directories and 'glob' patterns.
dependency-cruiser will
- resolve the glob patterns (if any) to files and directories
- scan directories (if any) for files with supported extensions
- add the passed files to that
... and start the cruise with the files thus found.

#### Cruising multiple files and directories in one go
Just pass them as arguments. This, e.g. will cruise every file in the folders
src, test and lib (recursively) + the file called index.ts in the root.

```sh
depcruise --output-type dot src test lib index.ts
```

#### passing globs as parameters
dependency-cruiser uses [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) to
make sure globs work the same accross platforms. It cannot prevent the
environment from expanding globs before it can process it, however.

As each environment interprets globs slightly differently, a pattern
like `packages/**/src/**/*.js` will yield different results.

To make sure glob expansion works _exactly_ the same accross
platforms slap some quotes around them, so it's not the environment
(/ shell) expanding the glob, but dependency-cruiser itself:

```sh
depcruise "packages/**/src/**/*.js"
```

### `--output-type`: specify the output format

#### err
For use in build scripts, in combination with `--config` e.g.

```sh
dependency-cruise --config my-depcruise-rules.json src
```

This will:
- ... print nothing and exit with code 0 if dependency-cruiser didn't
  find any violations of the rules in .dependency-cruiser.json.
- ... print the violating dependencies if there is any. Moreover it
  will exit with exit code _number of violations with severity `error` found_ 
  in the same fashion linters and test tools do.

See the _depcruise_ target in the [package.json](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser/blob/master/package.json#L55)
for a real world example.

#### dot
Supplying `dot` as output type will make dependency-cruiser write
a GraphViz dot format directed graph. Typical use is in concert
with _GraphViz dot_ (`-T` is the short form of `--output-type`:)

```shell
dependency-cruise -x "^node_modules" -T dot src | dot -T svg > dependencygraph.svg
```

> ##### ddot - summarize on folder level
> Since version 4.13.0 there's an _experimental_ `ddot` reporter that summarizes
> modules on folder level. It works fine, but its output is a tad more ugly
> than I'd like so there'll be tweaks to spruce it up in the future.

> ##### rcdot
> The `rcdot` reporter is deprecated.    
> Since version 4.12.0 `rcdot` reporter's
> coloring has become the default for the `dot` reporter, so `dot` and `rcdot`
> will yield the same results.

#### html
Write it to html with a dependency matrix instead:
```shell
dependency-cruise -T html -f dependencies.html src
```

#### csv
If you supply `csv` it will write the dependency matrix to a comma
separated file - so you can import it into a spreadsheet program
and analyze from there.

#### teamcity
Write the output in [TeamCity service message format](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/build-script-interaction-with-teamcity.html).

E.g. to cruise src (using the .dependency-cruiser config) and emit TeamCity messages to stdout:

```shell
dependency-cruise -v -T teamcity  -- src
```

```

</details>

Just like the `err` reporter the teamcity reporter has an empty output when there's
no violations - and a non-zero exit code when there's errors.

### `--config`/ `--validate`
Validates against a list of rules in a configuration file. This defaults to a file
called `.dependency-cruiser.json` (/ `.dependency-cruiser.js`), but you can
specify your own rules file, which can be in json format or a valid node
module returning a rules object literal.

```shell
dependency-cruise -x node_modules --config my.rules.json src spec
```

> _Tip_: usually you don't need to specify the rules file. However if run
> `depcruise --config src`, _src_ will be interpreted as the rules file.
> Which is probably is not what you want. To prevent this, place `--`
> after the last option, like so:
> ```
> dependency-cruise --config -- src
> ```

The configuration specifies a bunch of regular expressions pairs your dependencies
should adhere tom as well as configuration options that tweak what is cruised and
how.

A simple validation configuration that forbids modules in `src` to use stuff
in the `test` folder and allows everything else:

```json
{
    "forbidden": [{
        "from": {"path": "^src"},
        "to": {"path": "^test"}
    }]
}
```

You can optionally specify a name and an error severity ('error',  'warn' (the
default) and 'info') with them that will appear in some reporters:

```json
{
    "forbidden": [{
        "name": "no-src-to-test",
        "severity": "error",
        "from": {"path": "^src"},
        "to": {"path": "^test"}
    }]
}
```

For more information about writing rules see the [tutorial](rules-tutorial.md) and the
[rules-reference](rules-reference.md). The rules-reference also describes all the
[options](rules-reference.md#the-options).

For an easy set up of both use [--init](#--init)

### `--init`
This asks some questions and - depending on the answers - creates a dependency-cruiser
configuration with some useful rules to the current folder and exits.

The configuration file is larded with documentation to make it easy to tweak.

Use `--config` to have dependency-cruiser take the configuration file into account.

<details>
<summary>Some of the rules that will be in the configuration (either directly or from a
preset):</summary>


Rule                     | Description
---                      |---
`no-circular`            | flags all circular dependencies
`no-orphans`             | flags orphan modules (except typescript `.d.ts` files)
`no-deprecated-core`     | flags dependencies on deprecated node 'core' modules
`no-deprecated-npm`      | flags dependencies on deprecated npm modules
`no-non-package-json`    | flags (npm) dependencies that don't occur in package.json
`not-to-unresolvable`    | flags dependencies that can't be resolved
`no-duplicate-dep-types` | flags dependencies that occur more than once in package.json
`not-to-test`            | Don't allow dependencies from outside test folders to test folders
`not-to-spec`            | Don't allow dependencies to (typescript/ javascript/ coffeescript) spec files
`not-to-dev-dep`         | Don't allow dependencies from src/app/lib to a development only package
`optional-deps-used`     | Inform about the use of 'optional' dependencies (so you can ensure their imports a are sufficiently managed)
`peer-deps-used`         | Warn about the use of a peer dependency (they might be OK for you, but it's not typical you have them).
`no-duplicate-dep-types` | Warn if a dependency occurs in your package.json more than once (technically: has more than one dependency type)

### `--info` showing what alt-js are supported

Which alt-js languages dependency-cruiser supports depends on the availability
it has to them. To see how dependency-cruiser perceives its environment use
`depcruise --info` (any arguments are ignored). 

<details>
<summary>Typical output</summary>

```
Supported:

  If you need a supported, but not enabled transpiler ('✖' below), just install
  it in the same folder dependency-cruiser is installed. E.g. 'npm i livescript'
  will enable livescript support if it's installed in your project folder.

Transpilers:

  ✔ javascript (>es1)
  ✔ coffee-script (>=1.0.0 <2.0.0)
  ✔ coffeescript (>=1.0.0 <3.0.0)
  ✖ livescript (>=1.0.0 <2.0.0)
  ✔ typescript (>=2.0.0 <4.0.0)

Extensions:

  ✔ .js
  ✔ .mjs
  ✔ .jsx
  ✔ .vue
  ✔ .ts
  ✔ .tsx
  ✔ .d.ts
  ✖ .ls
  ✔ .coffee
  ✔ .litcoffee
  ✔ .coffee.md
  ✔ .csx
  ✔ .cjsx
```
</details>

### `--help` / no parameters
Running with no parameters gets you help.


## Options also available in dependency-cruiser configurations
Some of the `options` in dependency-cruiser configurations are also available as
command line options. They _override_ what's in the configuration, so they're great
if you need to quickly experiment with an option, or when you want to use one
configuration for multiple purposes.

The first four options below will be of use when you want to tame the size of
the visual representation of a big dependency graph. For the rest of the options
you're typically best off setting in a configuration file (generate one with
`depcruise --init`).

### `--do-not-follow`: don't cruise modules adhering to this pattern any further
If you _do_ want to see certain modules in your reports, but are not interested
in these modules' dependencies, you'd pass the regular expression for those
modules to the `--do-not-follow` (short: `-X`) option. A typical pattern you'd
use with this is "node_modules" (but be sure to check out the possibilities you
have with the [`doNotFollow` option](#./rules-reference.md#donotfollow-dont-cruise-modules-adhering-to-this-pattern-any-further))

```sh
dependency-cruise -X "^node_modules" -T html -f deps-with-unfollowed-node_modules.html src
```

Details and more ways to limit dependency-cruiser from following things: check out
the [doNotFollow](./rules-reference.md#donotfollow-dont-cruise-modules-adhering-to-this-pattern-any-further) 
option in the rules reference.

### `--exclude`: exclude modules from being cruised
If you don't want to see certain modules in your report (or not have them
validated), you can exclude them by passing a regular expression to the
`--exclude` (short: `-x`) option. Two examples:

```sh
dependency-cruise -x "node_modules" -T html -f deps-without-node_modules.html src
```

```sh
dependency-cruise -x "^(coverage|test|node_modules)" -T html -f deps-without-stuffs.html src
```

See the [exclude](./rules-reference.md#exclude-exclude-modules-from-being-cruised) option
in the rules reference for details.

### `--include-only`: only include modules satisfying a pattern
E.g. to only take modules into account that are in the `src` tree (and exclude all
node_modules, core modules and modules otherwise outside it):

```sh
dependency-cruise --include-only "^src" -T dot src | dot -T svg > internal-dependency-graph.svg
```

See [includeOnly](./rules-reference.md#includeonly-only-include-modules-satisfying-a-pattern) in the rules reference
for more details.

### `--max-depth`
Only cruise the specified depth, counting from the specified root-module(s). This
command is mostly useful in combination with visualisation output like _dot_ to
keep the generated output to a manageable size.

```sh
dependency-cruise --max-depth 2 -T dot src/main/index.ts | dot -T svg > depth-limited-dependency-graph.svg
```

See [maxDepth](./rules-reference.md#maxdepth)

> This will only be effective when you pass one file as an argument.

### `--prefix` prefixing links
In the dot output prefix links to the source files with a string - useful to link to
e.g. an on line repository.

```sh
dependency-cruise --prefix "https://github.com/you/yourrepo/tree/master/" -T dot src | dot -T svg > dependency-graph-with-links-to-gh.svg
```

See [prefix](./rules-reference.md#prefix-prefix-links-in-reports) in the rules reference
for details.

### `--module-systems`
Here you can pass a list of module systems dependency-cruiser should use
to detect dependencies. It defaults to `amd, cjs, es6`.

See [moduleSystems](./rules-reference.md#modulesystems) in the rules reference

### `--ts-pre-compilation-deps` (typescript only)
By default dependency-cruiser does not take dependencies between typescript
modules that don't exist after compilation to javascript. Pass this command
line switch to do take them into account.

For details see [tsPreCompilationDeps](./rules-reference.md#tsprecompilationdeps) in the
rules reference.

### `--ts-config`: use a typescript configuration file ('project')
If you use typescript and want dependency-cruiser to take the `baseDir`'s and/ or `paths`
in your tsconfig.json into account- can pass it with this option.

Although it's possible to pass it as a command line option, you typically 
want to do this in a configuration file - see 
[tsConfig](./rules-reference.md#tsconfig-use-a-typescript-configuration-file-project)
section in the rules reference for details.

### `--webpack-config`: use (the resolution options of) a webpack configuration
With a webpack config you can drastically alter how module names resolve to
files on disk, a.o. with aliases. If you want dependency-cruiser to take that
into account (you probaly do), you can pass the webpack config here.

However, just like with tsconfigs, you probably want to put this in a configuration
file - see the [webpackConfig](./rules-reference.md#webpackconfig-use-the-resolution-options-of-a-webpack-configuration)
section in the rules reference.

### `--preserve-symlinks`
Whether to leave symlinks as is or resolve them to their realpath. This option defaults
to `false` (which is also nodejs' default behavior since release 6).

You'll typically want to set this in the configuration file with the [preserveSymlinks](./rules-reference.md#preservesymlinks)
option.
