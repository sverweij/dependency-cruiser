# FAQ

## How do I enable TypeScript, CoffeeScript or LiveScript in dependency-cruiser?
You don't. They work out of the box.

## I'm developing in React and use jsx. How do I get that to work?
jsx works out of the box

## I use React, but with TypeScript and tsx. That works out of the box too?
Yep.

## I use the CoffeeScript variant of jsx (csx, cjsx)
Works out of the box.

## Let me guess, vue works out of the box as well?
You guessed correctly.

## Does this mean dependency-cruiser installs transpilers for all these languages?
No.

For LiveScript, TypeScript and CoffeeScript dependency-cruiser will use the
transpiler already in your project (or, if you installed dependency-cruiser
globally - the transpilers available globally).

This has a few advantages over bundling the transpilers as dependencies:
- `npm i`-ing dependency-cruiser will be faster.
- Transpilers you don't need won't land on your disk.
- Dependency-cruiser will use the version of the transpiler you are using
  in your project (which might not be the most recent one for valid reasons).

## Does this work with webpack configs (e.g. `alias` and `module`)?
Yes. You can feed dependency-cruiser a webpack configuration and it
will take the `resolve` section in there into account when cruising
your dependencies. This includes any `alias` you might have in there.

Currently dependency-cruiser supports a reasonable subset of webpack
config file formats:
- nodejs parsable javascript only
- webpack 4 compatilbe and up (although earlier ones _might_ work 
  there's no guarantee)
- exporting either:
  - an object literal
  - a function (webpack 4 style, taking up to two parameters)
  - an array of the above (where dependency-cruiser takes the
    first element in the array)

Support for other formats (promise exports, typescript, fancier
ecmascript) might come later.

## (typescript) some dependencies I'd expect don't show up. What gives?
### TL;DR
Use `--ts-pre-compilation-deps` or put `"tsPreCompilationDeps" : true` in
the `options` section of your `.dependency-cruiser.json`

### Longer
By default dependency-cruiser only takes post-compilation dependencies into
account; dependencies between typescript modules that exist after compilation
to javascript. Two types of dependencies do not fall into this category
- imports that aren't used (yet)
- imports of types only

If you _do_ want to see these dependencies, do one of these:
- pass `--ts-pre-compilation-deps` as a command line option
- if you have a `.dependency-cruiser.json`, put `"tsPreCompilationDeps" : true` in
the `options` section.

See [--ts-pre-compilation-deps-typescript-only](./cli.md#--ts-pre-compilation-deps-typescript-only)
for details and examples.

## How do I add support for my favorite alt-js language?
Ask me nicely.

Dependency-cruiser already supports TypeScript, CoffeeScript and LiveScript. If
there's another language (that transpiles to javascript) you'd like to see
support for, let me know.

... or add it yourself: your pull request is welcome. Recipe:
- In `package.json`:
  - add your language (and supported version range) to the `supportedTranspilers`
    object.
  - Add your language's transpiler to `devDependencies` (you'll need that,
    because you are going to write tests that prove the addition works
    correctly later on).
- In `src/transpile`
  - add a `yourLanguageWrap.js` that invokes the transpiler transforming
    your language into javascript (preferably ES6 or better, but lower versions
    should work as well). [`typeScriptWrap.js`](../src/extract/transpile/typeScriptWrap.js)
    as an example on how to do this.
  - in [`meta.js`](../src/extract/transpile/meta.js)
    - require `./yourLanguageWrap` and
    - add it to the `extension2wrapper` object with the extensions proper for your
    language.
- In `test/extract/transpile` add unit tests for `yourLanguageWrap`

## How do I add a new output format?

Like so:
- In `src/report`:
  - add a module that exports a default function that
    - takes a dependency cruiser output object
      ([json schema](../src/extract/jsonschema.json))
    - returns that same object with the values of the 'dependencies' attribute
      replaced by the string containing the output you want.
- In `main/index.js`
    - require that module and
    - add a key to the to the `TYPE2REPORTER` object with that module as value
- In `bin/dependency-cruise`
    - add it to the documentation of the -T option
- In `test/report` add unit tests that prove your reporter does what it
    intends.

## Does it work with my monorepo?

Absolutely. For every cruised module the closest `package.json` file is used to determine
if a package was declared as dependency.
