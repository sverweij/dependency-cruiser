# Dependency cruiser rules - reference

## Introduction

- This is a small reference guide to the elements you can use to write rules
  for dependency-cruiser. If you want a step-by-step introduction check the
  [rules _tutorial_](./rules-tutorial.md).
- There is a [json schema](../src/main/ruleSet/jsonschema.json)
  that describes the output format. Dependency-cruiser
  checks rule sets against it.
- Some examples:
  - a [starter rule set](../src/cli/rules.starter.json) - duplicated for
    perusal on the bottom of this file.
  - dependency-cruiser's [own rule set](../.dependency-cruiser-custom.json)
- Tip: run `depcruise --init` to create a .dependency-cruiser.json with
  some rules that make sense in most projects.

## The structure of a dependency cruiser rules file
The rules file is in json format. It can contain three sections - `forbidden`,
`allowed` and `options`:

```json
{
    "forbidden": [],
    "allowed": [],
    "options": {}
}
```

### `forbidden`
A list of rules that describe dependencies that are not allowed.
dependency-cruiser will emit a separate error (warning/ informational) message
for each violated rule.

### `allowed`
A list of rules that describe dependencies that are _allowed_. dependency-cruiser
will emit a 'not-in-allowed' message for each dependency that does not
satisfy at least one of them. The severity of the message is _warning_ by
default, but you can override it with `allowedSeverity`:

### `allowedSeverity`
The severity to use in reports when a dependency is not in the `allowed`
list of rules. It takes the same values as other `severity` fields and
also defaults to `warn`.

### `options`
Some of the command line options, so you don't have to specify them on each run.
The currently supported options are
[`doNotFollow`](./cli.md#--do-not-follow-dont-cruise-modules-adhering-to-this-pattern-any-further),
[`exclude`](./cli.md#--exclude-exclude-modules-from-being-cruised),
[`moduleSystems`](./cli.md#--module-systems),
[`prefix`](./cli.md#--prefix-prefixing-links),
[`tsPreCompilationDeps`](./cli.md#--ts-pre-compilation-deps-typescript-only),
[`preserveSymlinks`](./cli.md#--preserve-symlinks),
[`tsConfig`](./cli.md#--ts-config-use-a-typescript-configuration-file-project) and 
[`webpackConfig`](./cli.md#--webpack-config-use-the-resolution-options-of-a-webpack-configuration).
See the [command line documentation](./cli.md) for details.

## The structure of an individual rule
An individual rule consists at least of a `from` and a `to`
attribute that contain one or more conditions that trigger the rule, so
a minimal rule will look like this:

```json
{
    "from"    : {},
    "to"      : {}
}
```

A rule within the 'allowed' section can also have a `comment` attribute
which you can use to describe the rule.

Rules within the 'forbidden' section can have a `name` and a `severity`.

```json
{
    "name"    : "kebab-cased-name",
    "comment" : "(optional) description of the rule",
    "severity": "warn",
    "from"    : {},
    "to"      : {}
}
```

### `from` and `to`
Conditions an end of a dependency should match to be caught by this
rule. Leave it empty if you want any module to be matched.

The [conditions](#conditions) section below describes them all.

### `comment`
You can use this field to document why the rule is there. It's not
used in any rule logic.

### `name`
> (only available in the `forbidden` section )

A short name for the rule - will appear in reporters to enable
customers to quickly identify a violated rule. Try to keep them
short, eslint style. E.g. 'not-to-core' for a rule forbidding
dependencies on core modules, or 'not-to-unresolvable' for one
that prevents dependencies on modules that probably don't exist.

If you do not provide a name, dependency-cruiser will default it
to `unnamed`.

### `severity`
> (only available in the `forbidden` section )

How severe a violation of a rule is. The 'error' severity will make
some reporters (at least the `err` one) return a non-zero exit
code, so if you want e.g. a build to stop when there's a rule
violated: use that.

The other values you can use are `info` and `warn`. If you leave it
out dependency-cruiser will assume it to be `warn`.

## Conditions
### `path`
A regular expression an end of a dependency should match to be catched by this
rule.

In `from`, this is the path from the current working directory (typically your 
project root) to the file containing a dependency. In `to`, this is the path from
the current working directory to the file the dependency resolves to.

When path is in a `to` part of a rule it accepts the regular expression
'group matching' special variables `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, ...  as well. See
'group matching' below for an explanation & example.

### `pathNot`
A regular expression an end of a dependency should NOT match to be catched by
this rule.

When pathNot is in a `to` part of a rule it accepts the regular expression
'group matching' special variables `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, ...  just like the path
attribute. See 'group matching' below for an explanation & example.


### path specials

#### regular expressions - not globs
I chose _regular expressions_ for matching paths over the more traditional
_glob_ because they're more expressive - which makes it easier to specify
rules. Some common patterns

glob | regular expression | this expresses:
 --- | --- | ---
`*.js`     | `[^/]+\.js$` | files in the current folder with the extension _.js_
`src/**/*` | `^src` | all files in the _src_ folder
_not possible_ | `^src/([^/]+)/.+` | everything in the src tree - remember the matched folder name directly under src for later reference.

#### forward slashes
To make sure rules you specify run on all platforms, dependency-cruiser
internally represents paths with forward slashes as path separators
(`src/alez/houpe`).

#### 'group matching'
Sometimes you'll want to use a part of the path the 'from' part of your rule
matched and use it in the 'to' part. E.g. when you want to prevent stuff in
the same folder to be matched.

To achieve this you'll need to do two things:
- In the `from` of your rule:    
  Make sure the part of the `path` you want to be matched is between brackets.
  Like so: `"^src/([^/]+)/.+"`
- In the `to` part of your rule:    
  You can reference the part matched between brackets by using `$1` in `path`
  and `pathNot` rules. Like so: `"pathNot": "^src/$1/.+".`
- It is possible to use more than one group per rule as well. E.g. this
  expression `"^src/([^/]+)/[^\.]\.(.+)$"` has two groups; one
  for the folder directly under src, and one for the extension. The first is
  available in the `to` part of your rule with `$1`, the second with `$2`.
- The special variable `$0` contains the _whole_ matched string. I haven't
  seen a practical use for it in the context of depedendency-cruiser, but 
  I'll be glad to be surprised.

#### 'group matching' - an example: matching peer folders

Say you have the following folder structure
```
src
└── business-components
    ├── search
    ├── upsell
    ├── check-out
    ├── view-trip
    └── check-in
```

Business components should be completely independent of each other. So typically
you'd specify a rule like this to prevent accidents in the "forbidden" section:

```json
{
    "name": "no-inter-ubc",
    "comment": "Don't allow relations between code in business components",
    "severity": "error",
    "from": {"path": "^src/business-components/([^/]+)/.+"},
    "to": {
        "path": "^src/business-components/([^/]+)/.+"
    }
}
```

This will correctly flag relations from one folder to another, but also
relations _within_ folders. It's possible to get around that by specifying it
for each folder explicitly, leaving the current 'from' folder from the to
list e.g.    
_from: search, to: upsell|check-out|view-trip|check-in,_    
_from: upsell, to: search|check-out|view-trip|check-in,_    
 _..._

That'll be heavy maintenance though; especially when your
business components breed like a litter of rabbits. In stead, you can use
group matching:

```json
{
    "name": "no-inter-ubc",
    "comment": "Don't allow relations between business components",
    "severity": "error",
    "from": {"path": "^src/business-components/([^/]+)/.+"},
    "to": {
        "path": "^src/business-components/([^/]+)/.+",
        "pathNot": "^src/business-components/$1/.+"
    }
}
```
... which makes sure dependency-cruiser does not match stuff in the from folder
currently being matched.

### `couldNotResolve`
Whether or not to match modules dependency-cruiser could not resolve (and
probably aren't on disk). For this one too: leave out if you don't care either
way.

To get an error for each unresolvable dependency, put this in your "forbidden"
section:
```json
{
    "name": "not-to-unresolvable",
    "severity": "error",
    "from": {},
    "to": { "couldNotResolve": true }
}
```

### `circular`
A boolean indicating whether or not to match module dependencies that end up
where you started (a.k.a. circular dependencies). Leaving this out => you don't
care either way.

Detecting circular dependencies is heavy work. Especially on larger code bases
(thousands of files in one dependency graph) you might notice an impact on
the performance when you add a rule that checks for circular dependencies.

For example, adding this rule to the "forbiddden" section in your
.dependency-cruiser.json will issue a warning for each dependency that ends
up at itself.

```json
{
    "name": "no-circular",
    "severity": "warn",
    "from": { "pathNot": "^(node_modules)"},
    "to": { "circular": true }
}
```

### `license` and `licenseNot`
You can flag dependent modules that have licenses that are e.g. not
compatible with your own license or with the policies within your company with
`license` and `licenseNot`. Both take a regular expression that matches
against the license string that goes with the dependency.

E.g. to forbid GPL and APL licenses (which require you to publish your source
code - which will not always be what you want):

```json
{
    "name": "no-gpl-apl-licenses",
    "severity": "error",
    "from": {},
    "to": { "license": "GPL|APL" }
}
```
This raise an error when you use a dependency that has a string with GPL or
APL in the "license" attribute of its package.json (e.g.
[SPDX](https://spdx.org) compatible expressions like `GPL-3.0`, `APL-1.0` and
`MIT OR GPL-3.0` but also on non SPDX compatible)

To only allow licenses from an approved list (e.g. a whitelist provided by your
legal department):
```json
{
    "name": "only-licenses-approved-by-legal",
    "severity": "warn",
    "from": {},
    "to": { "licenseNot": "MIT|ISC" }
}
```

Note: dependency-cruiser can help out a bit here, but you remain responsible
for managing your own legal stuff. To re-iterate what is in the

### `dependencyTypes`
You might have spent some time wondering why something works on your machine,
but not on other's. Only to discover you _did_ install a dependency, but
_did not_ save it to package.json. Or you already had it in your devDependencies
and started using it in a production source.

To save you from embarassing moments like this, you can make rules with the
`dependencyTypes` verb. E.g. to prevent you accidentally depend on a
`devDependency` from anything in `src` add this to your
.dependency-cruiser.json's "forbidden" section:

```json
{
    "name": "not-to-dev-dep",
    "severity": "error",
    "comment": "because an npm i --production will otherwise deliver an unreliably running package",
    "from": { "path": "^src" },
    "to": { "dependencyTypes": ["npm-dev"] }
}
```

Or to detect stuff you npm i'd without putting it in your package.json:

```json
{
    "name": "no-non-package-json",
    "severity": "error",
    "comment": "because an npm i --production will otherwise deliver an unreliably running package",
    "from": { "pathNot": "^(node_modules)"},
    "to": { "dependencyTypes": ["unknown", "undetermined", "npm-no-pkg", "npm-unknown"] }
}
```

If you don't specify dependencyTypes in a rule, dependency-cruiser will ignore
them in the evaluation of that rule.

#### Ok - `unknown`, `npm-unknown`, `undetermined` - I'm officially weirded out - what's that about?

This is a list of dependency types dependency-cruiser currently detects.

 dependency type | meaning | example
 ---             | ---| ---
 local           | a module in your own ('local') package            | "./klont"
 localmodule     | a module in your own ('local') package, but which was in the `resolve.modules` attribute of the webpack config you passed| "shared/stuff.ts"
 npm             | it's a module in package.json's `dependencies`    | "lodash"
 npm-dev         | it's a module in package.json's `devDependencies`      | "chai"
 npm-optional    | it's a module in package.json's `optionalDependencies` | "livescript"
 npm-peer        | it's a module in package.json's `peerDependencies` - note: deprecated in npm 3 | "thing-i-am-a-plugin-for"
 npm-bundled     | it's a module that occurs in package.json's `bundle(d)Dependencies` array | "iwillgetbundled"
 npm-no-pkg      | it's an npm module - but it's nowhere in your package.json | "forgetmenot"
 npm-unknown     | it's an npm module - but there is no (parseable/ valid) package.json in your package |
 deprecated      | it's an npm module, but the version you're using or the module itself is officially deprecated                                | "some-deprecated-package"
 core            | it's a core module                                | "fs"
 aliased         | it's a module that's linked through an aliased (webpack)| "~/hello.ts"
 unknown         | it's unknown what kind of dependency type this is - probably because the module could not be resolved in the first place | "loodash"
 undetermined    | the dependency fell through all detection holes. This could happen with amd dependencies - which have a whole jurasic park of ways to define where to resolve modules to | "veloci!./raptor"

#### More than one dependencyType per dependency? `moreThanOneDependencyType`
With the flexible character of package.json it's totally possible to specify
a package more than once - e.g. both in the `peerDependencies` and in the
`dependencies`. Sometimes this is intentional (e.g. to make sure a plugin
type package works with both npm 2 and 3), but it can be a typo as well.

Anyway, it's useful to be conscious about it - you can b.t.w simply check
for it with a `moreThanOneDependencyType` attribute - which matches these
when set to true:

```json
{
    "name": "no-duplicate-dep-types",
    "severity": "warn",
    "from": {},
    "to": { "moreThanOneDependencyType": true }
}
```

When left out it doesn't matter how many dependency types a dependency has.

(If you're more of an 'allowed' user: it matches the 0 and 1 cases when set to
false).

### orphans

A boolean indicating whether or not to match modules that have no incoming
or outgoing dependencies. Orphans might need special attention because 
they're unused leftovers from a refactoring. Or the start of some feature
that never got finished but which was merged anyway. Leaving the `orphan`
attribute out means you don't care about orphans in your code.

Detecting orphans will have an impact on performance. You will probably
only notice it when you have a larger code base (thousands of modules
in your dependency graph), but it is something to
keep in mind.

To detect orphans guys you can add e.g. this snippet to your 
.dependency-cruiser.json's `forbidden` section:

```json
{
    "name": "no-orphans",
    "severity": "warn",
    "from": {"orphan": true},
    "to": {}
}
```

Things to keep in mind:
- dependency-cruiser will typically not find orphans when you give it
  only one  module to start with. Any module it finds, it finds by
  following its dependencies, so each module will have at least one
  dependency incoming or outgoing. Specify one or more folder, several
  files or a glob. E.g.    
  ```
  depcruise -v -- src lib test
  ```    
  will find orphans if they exist,
  whereas    
  ```sh
  depcruise -v -- src/index.ts
  ```    
  probably won't (unless index.ts is an orphan itself).
- by definition orphan modules have no dependencies. So when `orphan` is
  part of a rule, the `to` part won't make sense. This is why
  dependency-cruiser will ignore the `to` part of these rules.
- For similar reasons `orphan` is not allowed in the `to` part of rules.
- (_for API users only_) to prevent dependency-cruiser from
  needlessly running the orphan detection algorithm, it only runs it
  when there's an orphan rule in the rule set. If you want to have it
  the detection in without a rule set or without an orphan rule,
  pass `forceOrphanCheck: true` as part of the `pOptions` parameter.

}
