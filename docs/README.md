The bootstrap jumbotron + ukelele movie site on dependency-cruiser.

In the making.

#### In case you're confused:

- doc contains the documentation for dependency-cruiser (at the moment)
- docs (note the s - this folder) is the website.

Why the confusing names? _docs_ is what github uses by default for
github pages `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
